Exaggerated placental sites have been associated with emergency hysterectomies and abortions.Specimen #1 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, ""uterus and tubes"" and consists of a supracervical tan-pink uterine fundus (8.6 x 7.2 x 4.5 cm, 232 grams) with attached bilateral fimbriated fallopian tubes (right: 9.7 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm, left: 9.9 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm).  The uterine fundus serosal surface is tan-pink and smooth.  The cervical canal resection margin is markedly dilated (3.4 cm in diameter) with adhered clotted blood.  The cervical resection margin is inked blue and the uterine fundus is bivalved to reveal an endometrial cavity (6.5 x 4.0 cm) with a marked amount of adhered clotted blood and red-brown soft tissue ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 cm thick.  Both halves are serially sectioned to reveal a myometrium ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 cm with tightly adhered clotted blood and probable decidua.  The bilateral fallopian tubes are serially sectioned to reveal tan lumen.
